# NoteMD - Simple web based note

NoteMD is a simple but modern web note taking app by using markdown, built with Lit and web components.

## Get Started

The note are formatted by the [KnowledgeBase](https://github.com/ljcucc/knowledge-base) markdown foramt, using yaml at the top as metadata, for example:

```
---
title: This is title
...

the first horizen split must begin `---` and end with `...` .
```

## How it works?

just open index.html in browser. it's that simple.

> all notes are storage locally at localStorage.
